Meat Plant Inspections are carried out at ~900 Food Business Operator (FBO) establishments across England & Wales by ~800 staff and contract personnel.

The FBOs are distributed across 33 FSA operational clusters, each of which is managed by an Inspection Team Leader (ITL). 

Each ITL develops, maintains and reviews (at least once annually) a [Statement of Resource](sor-context) (SOR) for each establishment in their cluster.
* These set out expected inspection resourcing requirements that the FSA will deliver (and charge) against. 
* They are used as the basis for planning local resourcing requirements through rotas. 

Each of the 33 ITLs maintains their own staffing rota to **coordinate and communicate workforce allocations** within their cluster of establishments. 
* These are set out on a weekly schedule (though may be prepared considerably more in advance).
* Up to [100 amendments](volumes-and-metrics) to 'finalised' rotas may be required each week due to unplanned or late changes.

FSA rotas are shared with a Service Delivery Partner to identify workforce shortfalls that will need to be fulfilled by contractors. The Service Delivery Partner maintains their own suite of rotas to **allocate contract staff** and **coordinate FSA worker requests and rota changes**, which are handled by 18 Resource Managers and Administrators nationally.
