## Rota Pain Points

*   Rotas are heavily manual (excel), and multiple formats proliferate.
    *   Each ITL has preferred ways of completing, versioning, & broadcasting.
*   They are used to communicate a very wide range of information simultaneously to multiple audiences. Rotas suffer from bloat of information and the core purpose is obscured.
    *   Daily tasks, movement between plants etc.
    *   It’s a tall order for ITL not to miss something.
    *   Team relied on to distribute as ITL is remote
*   Distribution is manual and variable, easy to miss a cc address.
*   Last minute requests create a communication chain reaction with the SDP & often neighbouring clusters.
*   Far range planning occurs on both sides (ITL & ARM) but visibility isn’t uniformly granted/shared (Leave, training)
*   Handoff points (week+1) to SDP are variable, guidance exists but isn’t uniformly adhered to. Impacting the SDP.
*   Condensed time constraints pressure and cause a vicious cycle, so that a bad week gets very bad quickly (doesn’t scale)
*   Multiple parties can become embroiled in trading solutions.
*   The fire-fighting of one week then impacts the next etc.
*   No authoritative version of the week as worked stored.


## Rota Opportunities


### Technology

*   Single source of truth - a live web based rota with version & status.
*   Automatic update leave, trainings, secondment etc.
*   Distribution & change notification system

### Process

*   Early visibility & shared planning (transparency & openness)
*   Earlier cut offs, clear ‘no change’ periods.
*   Clear bi-directional partnership relationship with SDP


### People

*   Consideration and voice for all stakeholders, including frontline staff, SDP, reporting users etc.
*   Behaviour change - leave request cut offs, right tool right job.

### Rota Pain Points:


### Creators:



*   If I share advance rotas with the SDP they sometimes fail to wait until they're confirmed
*   I can't easily bulk change names or shift times on multiple future weeks
*   Without visibility, my staff have to ask for more short notice leave requests
*   There are so many inputs that inform rotas (itrent, bulletins, opps schedules etc.)
*   My team are small and don't divide nicely into 25%, its hard not to exceed the leave limit
*   The mental load of balancing all these considerations is significant
*   It's easy to leave someone in twice (rows per plant duplication)
*   I struggle to pick up some other ITL's own formats, or they'll introduce them if covering mine.
*   If a cell contains a key task, staff can read that as the ONLY work required
*   Extra information being contained in the rota also lives elsewhere, leading to duplication an confusion
*   I often miss a tick or the SDP spots an error which could be a problem
*   File sizes can grow to be massive (contain tabs for past & future rota's )
*   It's easy to miss a key contact off a large circulation because it can vary week to week
*   The SDP can mistake future rota drafts in rhe document for final plans when they aren't ready yet
*   Potential for service failure if the SDP has changed anything other than CMHI fields by accident
*   E&J don't edit the version numbers, or file name so the only indicator it's been returned are CMHI names
*   Multiple versions of the rota now exist in circulation (ITL drive, SDP/ AM/ OV, emails & now print)
*   Not all frontline staff are so well connected, tech literate, available or driven to check email
*   No consolidated view of who is working on a given day (MHI + CMHI + OV)
*   Under pressure to flex the rules (for FSA staff, the FBO) - non-adherence to business rules
*   Further multiple versions saved and in circulation. Recipients or I myself may confuse them
*   Team members with lower tech literacy / propensity to check emails are hard to pin down
*   I have to chase people, often at antisocial times or check multiple channels (teams, email, texts, voice)
*   Firefighting the current week  delays/condenses time preparing the next +1 week
*   Confusing thinking about the features of two weeks at once
*   Confusing having two sets of excel files in communications between ITL and the SDP
*   There may be two sets of distribution lists after an update - confusing reply chains in inbox
*   Variable practices updating the rota in response to emergencies / last minute changes
*   No authoritative version of the truth kept on file for later - what was worked may differ significantly
*   There are no consistent practices around rota file retention after the week is worked


### Collaborators:



*   SDPs cannot confidently grant annual leave to CMHIs without visibility of FSA leave (but have to)
*   SDP is held up waiting for the last ITLs request to arrive before work can commence
*   The SDP can sometimes struggle to fill multiple requests on mondays and fridays
*   The SDP struggles significantly to read and interpret the requests from multiple different personalised rotas
*   ITLs use inconsistent versioning methods, and often forget to update them
*   ITLs sending repeated updates require waves or repeated rework by the SDP
*   SDP are bombarded with high volume of change requests in a very tight time window
*   Each single request and edit creates a wide comms chain of events within SDP field staff estate
*   Process of editing the rota could happen multiple times on the same day or/and over several days
*   SDP is frequently sent short notice requests for non-emergencies
*   SDP are under pressure to fulfil all requests, even contract breaching ones
*   SDP are still affected by multiple change requests resulting from ITLs 'horse trading'


### Rota Opportunities:



*   Clear future week status 'DRAFT' or edit permission locks
*   Provide the SDP with greater advance visibility of 'known known's' and 'known unknowns'
*   Engage the SDP sooner for key events - proactive planning & sharing
*   An earlier 'mid-point' review with the SDP to anticipate issues further out.
*   Easy update 'copy to all future weeks' shortcuts
*   Cut off rota planning sooner to give staff more visibility / reduce short term leave
*   Enforce lead time guidance, e.g. automate requests send off
*   Improve consistency of timeframes in which rota's are worked up across regions/ clusters
*   Tool with calendar and inbox sync suggestions
*   Auto calculate absence rate figure for the week ( contractor limits at 25%)
*   Provide AM's with  data so ITL's can be held accountable for late rotas / exceeded limits
*   Provide ITLs with greater visibility of SDP capacity to  encourage more balance of leave across the week
*   Supply a 'checklist of events, tasks, factors' to ease cognitive load
*   Build in 'can't be in 2 places at once' failsafe or e.g. hints if Itrent shows the person is on AL
*   Standardise the display of information that occurs reliably across all sites and clusters
*   Use daily activity information break down to pre-populate timesheets
*   Provide a 'note tag' feature for any cell, so that it doens't have to compete with the cells key purpose
*   Run rota past FSA team before sending to SDP to help spot any key omissions that will be issues later
*   Smart auto-versioning, date and author indicators
*   "Single source of truth" living document - so there is only one reference point per week
*   Formal handoff with document status locked. Author based editing permissions
*   A short 'go dark' period. Hold changes until the first request has been returned from the SDP
*   Supply per plant per day totals to help the ITL validate if rota is complete to requirement
*   Lock down any content that SDP do not need to edit
*   Smart auto-versioning, date stamping and author indicators of fields changed
*   Document the rota's audit trail so that anyone looking at it can know it's broad history and status
*   Distribution automation - inbuilt address book so no-one is forgotten
*   Clarify guidance and hold ITLs to account with data (e.g. must supply reason / record with AM)
*   Notifications & Alerts (2 tiers: 1 for check urgently, 1 for information only)
*   'Read receipt' functionality for frontline staff, automatic escalation if shift is in under 48hrs
*   Digitise day book entries to help pre-populate or reconcile against rota in timesheets
*   Improve practices around rota retention & storage
