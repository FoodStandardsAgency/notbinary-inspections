Building a plant profile solves a part of the pain point of "local knowledge". ITLs are invaluable as they have all the information, however if they leave or are off this knowledge is unavailable.
Introducing sections to the SOR will help create clear delineation between the document, the plant, the jobs being done. The plant profile is something that, in future, could be it's own document. In the first instance we can begin to build this profile by capturing information in the SOR:
* Premesis open and close times
* Number of inspections points
* Number of production lines and shifts (this information is currently stored in an FSA database)

By creating a plant profile the FSA can more accurately assign resources and allow new members of staff easy access to information from a centralised point.
