The table view is a departure from the current method of form entry for species, through put and line speed information. We believe that this will make it easier and quicker for ITLs to complete SORs using a table approach.
The benefit is that the user can see an overview of all the information at once for a given week. At the moment the user has to enter rows for various different types of information, leading to a long and confusing process.

We are proposing that there is one table to contain all weekly data of number of shifts, species, production lines and roles. This could become quite a large, and intimidating table, however there is a lot of information required and so this would be an acceptable trade off for having all the information together in one page. The presentation of this table should be considered, time should be taken with an Interface Design specialist to ensure that usability is effectively translated to the implementation.

The feedback was generally positive to move forward with this approach. There is certainly work to do during the alpha stage in order to get this correct, however users were onboard with the concept. The recommendation also includes that this table should be as close to an "web based Excel" as can be achieved to ensure speed when moving around it and user familiarity.

The images above contain prototypes built with Excel. This is to illustrate the layout - a wireframe - rather than a suggested design. Points of consideration are large cells for ease of use, tabbed navigation, and autofill cells.
