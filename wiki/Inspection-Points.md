The FSA does not currently have any centeralised store of plant information. This is useful information that is missing. Capturing this data at the SOR stage would be beneficial to begin building this knowledge base. 

Stating the number of inspection points would also encourage ITLs to think of the SOR as a plant resource tool, rather than a rota related tool - this abstract document idea that we are trying to convey.
