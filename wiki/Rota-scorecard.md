## Understand the rota scorecard
The scorecard provides a way to record how new ideas, prototypes and/or off-the-shelf products for creating, managing and maintaining Meat Plant Inspection Service rotas compare with user needs and the current tools and/or way of working.

The scorecard has been organised by job role and the "as is" process which is current at December 2019. It should inform any future product improvement or configuration, service design work. Scorecards can be iterated for each stage of development.

It can also be used to score off-the-shelf products.
