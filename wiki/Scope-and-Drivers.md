## Context 

There is an operational link between Statements of Resource (SOR), rotas and timesheeting. 

SOR and rotas could drive more efficient and accurate timesheeting through
* re-use of data 
* reducing manual overheads 
* standardising approaches to Field Ops workforce management

Right now, these resourcing tools and processes are not robust enough to support these improvements.

## Goals

This discovery will build on the recent Timesheeting Discovery to more fully understand
* the **limitations of the current resourcing tools** used to support the inspections service, and 
* their **potential** to better enable the service, including the goal of timesheeting by exception

Key components of the meat plant inspections service in this context are:
* operational delivery and review
* contract management
* charging and payments

## Scope 

The primary enquiry lines should help 
* understand how SOR and rota fit into inspection management **workflow**
* examine what **data** is captured and how it is used
* examine **accuracy and consistency** of SOR and rota tools 
* understand what the resourcing **tools don’t support** or enable
* examine **potential** to drive integrated timesheeting, SOR and rotas
* understand cultural **constraints** for inspection management service redesign

This discovery builds on previous work. To avoid duplication and focus on the resourcing tools in the inspection management context within the time available, we aren’t looking into or revisiting:
* forecasting models based on resourcing tools and data
* charging model basis and codes review
* timesheeting
* broader HR & finance system review
