The current SOR system does not allow for reliable version control. There are no version numbers and ITLs mainly use the last edited meta data. Our research showed that once completed, an SOR (and rotas) are emailed out and various versions can be sent around via email.

We have several ideas to remove this pain point:
- Make the SOR viewable from within the system - We give the option to send a link out to a centrally held and updated SOR. This is a reference link for FBOs, SDPs and plant staff. By sending the link out we can ring fence the SOR and keep it in a closed working environment, while maintaining and increasing visibility to all parties and departments.
- Each time the SOR is saved (main or temporary) it cycles to the next version number. So main will start 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 etc. When a temporary SOR is created, this is saved to a version of that SOR. So Xmas 2019 v1, v1.1 etc.

There will always be a Main version of the SOR. This will be available to switch back to from temporary SORs.
