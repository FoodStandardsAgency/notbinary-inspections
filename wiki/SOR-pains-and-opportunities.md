The following themes of user pains have been identified in the course of Discovery.


## SOR Pain Points

*   SOR preparatory work is offline, heavily manual (notes & calculations) and discussion based.
*   SOR creation and data entry is hindered by a system with poor basic navigation, content and input usability leading to errors.
*   Basic screen inputs, page layout, headings and format hinder users; leading to errors and inconsistency.
*   Navigation within the pages is constricted; hard to cross reference information within it.
*   SOR data input is laborious for plant with complex arrangements (e.g. multi-shift, multi-species, multi-staffed).
*   A large amount of ‘data reconciliation’ is needed to complete staffing numbers, throughput and hours allocation when the system could be doing the ‘heavy lifting’.
*   SOR outputs are not working for all audiences that must consume them, necessitating rework and duplication.


### SOR Creators


#### Preparation

*   Time poor users with multiple plant clusters often can’t easily notice when a SOR review might be required or is due.
*   What changes (minor or major change) should trigger an SOR review are inconsistently understood between ITL’s.
*   Negotiation with the FBO (and SDP consultation) can be a time consuming back and forth, by which time a trigger or need may have changed.


#### Data Entry

*   Poor rural connectivity speeds and available uptime of the SOR K2 often hinder access from both home or plant locations.
*   Searching for plants by approval number relies on local knowledge, which can be difficult for covering area managers or new and in training ITLs
*   Locating the most recent or active version of the SOR to select is often hard to accurately identify from the search result list.
*   Creating a new SOR from scratch is time consuming, users inconsistently choose to either duplicate and edit an existing one, or directly edit the old one.
*   Matching hours to activities is a very laborious task because of how the system lays out the information / should be automatically assigned.
*   Variances in plant size and nature plus roles required create exponentially more complex page layout and data input challenges for the user.
*   Use of the fields is inconsistent between ITLs. For example, a misunderstanding or confusion about how long line breaks are. Some users think 1.0 means 1 break, others think this means 1 hour (which is does).


#### Handoff

*   Obtaining and storing a signed copy of the final SOR from the FBO is rarely completed consistently.
*   Users often create new versions of the information contained in the PDF output so that key audiences can better use them (poor layout, content usability, omissions)


### SOR Collaborators

*   SOR changes are primarily triggered by the FBO at short notice, creating a pressure to be reactive.
*   Service Delivery Partners and OV’s are shut out of the creation process, they often possess a lot more local knowledge of the sites realities than the remote ITL does.
*   Service Delivery Partners do not have access to the K2 system, only the PDF output which they find insufficiently detailed for resource planning and timesheet review.


### SOR Consumers

*   Plant based OV/MHI’s find it hard to interpret their shift times and duties and g-code logging instructions from the PDF output of the SOR.
*   It can be hard for ITLs to illustrate their resourcing suggestions or decisions upfront to the FBO 
*   It can be hard for the FBO to infer their charging outcomes from the SOR output.


## SOR Opportunities In Summary

*   Improve the basic usability of the SOR entry flow, with navigation, quick links and interaction improvements. Structure, group and layout page content to aid scanning. 
*   Improve field labelling language to improve comprehension and consistency of use.
*   Codify guidance for users into the system e.g. SOR checklist and contextual help. 
*   Surface data held elsewhere for easy cross reference (e.g. last review, plant information, timesheet and throughput data).
*   Wherever possible auto-populate information based on business rules and data held elsewhere. E.g. G-codes and hours allocation. Provide editable suggestions as a starter.
*   Improve the completion and handoff flow (auto handoff, distribution and versioning) 
*   Improve the output documentation usability for all audiences, with possible custom views (reduce duplication of effort)
*   Build in a simple notification system for when SOR’s are due for review
*   Consider an upfront resourcing planner / calculator to support FBO negotiation


## Full Pain Points & Opportunity Landscape

Based on the [user journey map](sor-user-journey).


### SOR Pain Points

*   PowerBI data isn't always trusted to be accurate.
*   Not easy to get hold of the FBO is he's resistant to changing it
*   Must manage FBO expectations -  possible lengthy turnaround
*   The K2 system is very slow in some locations and often down
*   Covering ITLs or AMs may not know the site code from memory
*   Hard to identify the most recent and active SOR in results list (sort by & status)
*   Old drafts can't be deleted, only completed, cluttering results
*   Only a single click opens the SOR (double click doesn't work)
*   Not clear what should go in comments -  many thing to many people
*   Discount rate isn't known at this stage - can't be completed here
*   The effective from is used inconsistently (past, present and future)
*   Several open text comments fields, unclear which type go where
*   An end date is never used for fear of 'dropping off' (missed review)
*   Shift Allowance information isn't top of mind, user has to leave the system to check
*   Start time is used inconsistently by different ITLs
*   Entering start/end times day by day is repetitive (often each day follows a pattern)
*   Shift straddling midnight must be added as two shifts, when they are really one
*   Must exit the system to obtain accurate throughput data or rely on word of the FBO
*   Daily tasks appear in multiple rows per day, without day boundaries (hard to scan)
*   New or busy ITLs find it harder to estimate staffing needs of an unfamiliar plant
*   The line breaks field is being misunderstood and used inconsistently between ITLs
*   Editing start and end times one at a time per role and day is laborious
*   CMHI rows are separated from MHI rows by OVs. They can be missed or just not used
*   The default grouping of rows is visually hard to scan or mentally total hours spent per day
*   Manually assigning hours is repetitive and time consuming for large complex sites.
*   Hours allocation input is prone to human error and difficult to diagnose
*   Upon saving the system throws the user out -must re-enter to view / print PDF
*   FBOs rarely return a signed copy
*   Field staff & SDP can't understand their hours and codes from the PDF
*   No easy way of remembering when an SOR is due to review, reliant on setting a calendar reminder (Not all users are comfortable and familiar with Power BI yet)
*   System wide, pages are hard to navigate between and disorientating (hard to cross ref information between pages)
*   System wide, field labels are frequently confusing or missing


### SOR Opportunities

*   Guidance on what change threshold triggers SOR review
*   Provide guidance on what time period should constitute a temporary SOR versus absorbing into rotas (eg, only a week, two weeks), versus updating the permanent SOR.
*   Cost illustrator / calculator to support conversation with FBO
*   Suggest cluster / regional sites by name (but not locked by region)
*   Provide offline sync and design pages for minimal load
*   Flag the 'active' SOR record, in addition to drafts and default sort by edit date.
*   Allow deletion of old drafts and version archiving
*   Provide quick options from the results list (view, edit, copy, generate PDF)
*   Clarify in system what type of information to record in comments
*   Clarify effective From: date discussed, agreed, enacted, (to be worked)?
*   Automate the 'discount' field or remove and communicate elsewhere
*   Change 'End of' field name to 'Next review due' to encourage use
*   'Daylight savings' style switch while on a temporary or seasonal SOR (auto or manual
*   Auto apply the shift allowance and overtime rates according to guidance
*   Clarify how start & end times should be used: time open, time of 1st kill, time on the line
*   Quick entry shortcuts for start/end time patterns by day of the week
*   Surface throughput averages (as a guide) from other systems
*   Clearly group days and tasks visually for easier scanning and editing
