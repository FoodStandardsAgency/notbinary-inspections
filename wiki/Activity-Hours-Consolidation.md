We found a large pain point to be the matching of hours per day against activity. Users had to move up and down the page and we heard that it took some users several hours to get this right. 
We believe that by introducing a visual feedback for users in the style of a progress bar (consistent with timesheeting) this could make the process a lot easier for users.

As the hours on the activity are added, the bar fills up:

There are extra hours for activities that are more ad-hoc or monthly, these will not be related to the progress bar. For any activities that are ad-hoc per month or week they can be stated along with estimated hours.

The message to communicate to our users is that the SOR is a guideline of hours to be worked, it is not a definitive document.
