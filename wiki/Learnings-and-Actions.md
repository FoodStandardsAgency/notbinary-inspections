## Be user-driven

Existing **guidance is insufficient** and ambiguous, which encourages **inconsistent ways of working**.  
* The current resourcing tools have evolved locally (both in scope and geographically) and organically, without a clear service direction.  
* Learned behaviours and habits proliferate and are hard to shift by imposing technology solutions. 
* Future changes should be intentionally designed. 
* Users need to be meaningfully involved in that design process from the outset in order to change deeply ingrained ways of working.

## Be service-led

If “what you get is what you measure”, better **service-wide metrics** can help **re-train organisational behaviours** for a more connected service. 
* Metrics are not well defined, partly because the resourcing process is a disjointed set of activities.
* Re-mapping the desirable end-to-end resourcing process will help identify what data is needed to manage the service.
* Do this with service stakeholders to build consensus and trust in data outputs.
* Own the service.

## Involve partners and customers early
External views are vital to **establish context**, needs and impact, to **build consensus** and to * avoid internal bias. 
* The business operating model relies on third parties to ensure a flexible workforce to fulfil resourcing needs. 
* Current service provision is disjointed with multiple handoffs.
* Internal and external stakeholders have partial context and visibility of resourcing parameters, which creates friction in decision process.
* While the FSA owns the service, supply chain partners have a stake and can contribute greatly to better, holistic service design that will benefit all. 

## Unlock local knowledge
Surface and **share “local knowledge”** to reduce cognitive load and associated manual overheads, and to **improve organisational memory**.
* Capture local knowledge in the appropriate systems at an appropriate time
   * Be canonical and avoid duplication
   * Don’t try and get everything all at once, just in case. 
* Re-use data by presenting it back to users at the point that it’s relevant, across systems, department functions and jobs. 
* Avoid using abstract codes and jargon when looking up and displaying reference content.
