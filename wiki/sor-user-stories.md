## Understand the SOR user stories
The user stories describe the key requirements that should be met to enable the creation, management and maintenance of Statements of Resource documents. Meeting these requirements will enable a critical component of the Meat Plant Inspection Service.

The user stories have been organised by job role and the "as is" process which is current at December 2019. They should inform any future process improvement and service design work.
