Currently the ITL has to manually calculate the additional charges for the FBO. We know that these rules are stored in a document and could be transferred to a digital system. This would reduce the amount of manual effort, or cognitive load, for the user. We also know that the SOR is not a legally binding document and (in relation to our findings and recommendations) should not be used for rota creation, that is the planning of individual's needs/contracts per plant.

We recommend that estimated charges and how to resolve these could be shown to the ITL on screen at the end of the SOR creation process _(This could work well if the SOR was created during the meeting with an FBO._). 

Once all the information has been entered into the SOR, the system will compare the entered information against the business rules around excessive charges. For any that are met, the system will feedback to the user along with a solution that could be put in place to alleviate this.

In the future, a fully integrated system that plugs into the HR and forecasting databases could be used to also take into account permanent staff available at a plant/area and give an even more accurate level of detail about excessive charges.
