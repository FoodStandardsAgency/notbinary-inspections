## Inspection Team Leaders 

### About Them

*   Typically many years in the industry, usually as a long serving MHI
*   Most are nearing retirement and  Male
*   Varied cluster profiles and volumes from ITL to ITL
    *   Some juggling far more complexity than others
*   Self sufficient / directed but time poor.
*   Flexible & reactive in order to put out fires
*   Time poor and necessarily reactive.
*   Focus is their  team (permanent FSA staff)
    *   Mixed attitudes to SDPs & FBO partnerships
*   Know their patch & team:
    *   Local ‘hero’ rep but also a Single Point of Failure
    *   Not in a file, it’s all in their head (local knowledge & reference)
*   Variable adherence to deadlines & SLA agreement terms. (Rota)
*   Approach to managing SDP resources & FBO’s requests:
    *   Many are stuck in a reactive cycle, rather than proactive

### About Their Role

*   Frontline face and voice of the FSA to the meat industry.
*   Instrumental coordinators of the inspection service, ensuring it keeps functioning.
*   Managers, suppliers, procurers and auditors of MHI labour.
*   Paperwork recorder, reviewer and maintainer (SOR, timesheet sign off).
*   Request and communication gateway for:
    *   Own staff/HR (Holiday, absence, grievance, retirement planning, etc.)
    *   FBO (filter requests that will have an impact on resourcing)
    *   Ops/HQ (training & development, guidelines, charging)
    *   SDP (resourcing challenges daily & seasonally)

### Context

*   Remote/Home based
*   Travelling regularly to visit plants (In & out of site office)
*   Reachable mostly by phone or text, rather than email.
    *   Not always reachable in plant/while driving.
*   No time onsite to use terminals, would use own laptop
    *   Paper notes and print outs travel with him more easily to sites with poor signal.
*   Largely disconnected from other ITL’s nationally
    *   Siloed decisions, not collectively made or informed.
*   Removed from central FSA - at the bottom of an information trickle down
*   Left largely to FIOFYS - Figure it out for yourself or lean on a small network of go-to colleagues (e.g. AM, neighbouring cluster ITL or who they trained with)


### Technology

*   Tech literacy is mixed
*   Microsoft Heavy
*   Mixed adoption rates of new tools & processes (Power BI, Office Teams)
*   Attitude of ‘my devices, my filing system (naming, versioning, storage - even print records)
*   Legacy led and continuity of style of predecessor / who trained them.
*   Bias away from central server / systems use in favour of saving files locally.
*   Reference information is collated not in a file or document but built up over time in their heads.

### Key Responsibilities

*   Manage placement of inspectors: right numbers / skill / place / time
*   Manage customer relationship - consultant/supplier/auditor to FBO
*   Line Management to MHI’s

### SOR

*   Co-ordinate with E&J on resourcing feasibility & structure
*   Document the needs of the FBO operation (line speed, throughput, hours, meta-data)
*   Agreement documentation (for future reference / consult)
*   Maintain the annual / seasonal review schedule
*   Monitor accuracy, efficiency & suitability over time
*   Set staff expectations (contract model, hours, line speed, overtime).

### Rota 

*   Provide appropriate staffing level to FBO weekly & daily in line with SOR
*   Facilitate logistics of getting people to plants
*   Monitor & predict shortages (holiday, absence, training, seasonal peaks)
*   Short term planning and reacting to blockers/real time events
*   Communicate high level daily activities to the teams (MHI / cMHI)
    *   Location (usual site or offsite / new site), hours, am/pm shifts start & end, 
*   Coordinate with SDP counterpart to supply suitable contract staffing
*   Maintain regular rest days/rotations for FSA staff to balance team wellbeing
*   Supply visibility to staff where to be and when daily (on the line, rotation duties, breaks etc.)
*   Supply visibility to the FBO regarding team capability & how positions are to be manned day to day.
*   Apply local knowledge to staffing - skill, location, contacts, t’s & c’s, contracts, plant needs, casual inspectors / relief support etc.

### Key Persona Pain Points

*   Dealing with very real staffing challenges daily, pressure to deliver resource
*   Constantly busy / juggling or spinning plates / keeping the lights on, little time to invest in monitoring and proactive planning.
*   Removed from the onsite reality of many plants in their cluster, not first hand.
*   Team are hard to reach during shift hours and of low tech literacy, required lots of phone calls, voicemail and text to confirm messages have been received.
*   Having to fairly accommodate multiple different contract types among FSA staff.


## Service Delivery Partners (Area Resource Managers & Admin Support)

### About Them

*   One of circa 12 Area Resource Managers nationally
*   Typically an OV by training with MHI field experience
*   May provide in-plant / on-line support in a pinch
*   English is a second language, yet proficient.
    *   Staff they manage may have less and have a different 1st language.
*   Flexible in reacting to customer requests; a supplier mindset. 
*   Organised record keeper, diary manager and communicator.
*   Juggler and prioritiser of which fires to put out.
*   Seeking to be as proactive as possible in anticipating resource needs (forecasting)

### About Their Role

*   The key contact of the ITL at the SDP
*   Manage a broader geographic remit, serving 3-5 ITL’s and their Area Manager.
*   Juggling resource allocation across multiple clusters and plants at once.
*   Line manage 50-80 (contract) MHI’s across several and variable FBO sites.
    *   A mix of mostly full time employed (by SDP), some zero hrs and casual contractors. 
    *   Many are past FSA MHI’s so know the ropes
    *   Some are overseas workers with a lot of flexibility to take overtime
    *   Some are OV trained, on MHI conversion/ access to specialism paths.
    *   Mixture of staff being located permanently in one plant or moving around.
    *   May also be supplying contract PIA’s (Poultry Inspection Assistants to the FBO (outside of FSA track).
*   Work closely with their colleague and counterpart, the Area Veterinary Manager, who supplies OV’s to their areas’ plants. 
*   Supported by a specific head office admin for building Rota’s (who is shared with other ARM’s in her region). Also supports AVM in creation of the separate OV rota’s.
*   Balancing supplier duties (contract to FSA) with own staff contracts (rights and preferences e.g. reasonable travel / leave requests) with cost efficiency of allocations for SDP management.

### Context

*   Home based with a lot of travel within their patch..
*   Visits sites to conduct staff spot checks, 1:1’s, meet with OV & FBO’s.
*   Often driving and trying to take calls/text/voicemail when trying to contact staff at short notice.
*   Split focus - liaising with and communicating across multiple audiences streams at once (ITL/FBO/SDP MHI’s) 
*   Time-sensitivity is key - rota’s and filling of gaps has to happen in very fast turnarounds, often requiring immediate action.
*   ‘Always on’ out of hours availability, not by choice but by necessity. Frequently called up when ITL’s are non-responsive.

### Technology

*   Logs onto a remote desktop to a central E&J server.
*   Ageing Microsoft Operating System but organised shared drives/ file structures.
*   Moderate digital literacy in Microsoft Office, but working with counterparts at FSA and in the field that have variable literacy.
*   She uses (OV colleagues maintain) their own ‘plant profiles’ per FBO’s and skill scorecards for their employees.

### Key Responsibilities 

(Informs Needs / Goals)

*   Managing and fulfilling FSA ITL contract MHI requests, short term (rota) and longer term (SOR and planning).
    *   Forecasting loosely (as far as possible) for busy periods with the ITL’s input.
    *   Liaising with OV/AVM/CMHI plant staff, hearing plant realities / sensing changes on the ground e.g creeping overtime.
*   Contract MHI line management duties, planning and recruitment
    *   HR & Employer duties such as contract management, 1:1’s, approving leave requests, SDP timesheeting processes.
    *   Some recruitment and onboarding (supported by head office and admin).
*   Ensuring meat inspection services delivered are to the required skill and standard.
    *   Training, spot checks, incident investigation, managing FBO/ITL complaints.

### SOR

*   Low involvement in their creation. A ‘consumer’ more than ‘collaborator’, dependent on the ITL. 
*   Usually ITL informs them of a change without much notice or consulting them first. 
*   Do what they can to fulfil a change, rarely envoke the 30 days clause they are contractually entitled to unless a new / additional OV is required.
*   Head office managers have access to K2 but she doesn’t.
*   Only receives / has visibility of the PDF version of the SOR, can’t deduce how some figures have been reached.
*   Sometimes knows more about the plant’s current reality / needs than the ITL will (sometimes have more on-the ground contacts than they do e.g. OV, PIA’s)

### Rota

*   More involvement in Rota’s than SOR’s.
*   She is focussed on forward planning and forecasting staffing needs for busy/quiet periods, encouraging the ITL’s to engage with them early.
*   Chasing the ITL for late supplied rota’s (7 days before wc date to be worked).
*   Admin builds and maintains the Rota (storage, completion, communication and versioning) using skill match cards and plant profiles (SDP knowledge assets) to choose appropriate resources.
*   ARM supports by reviewing the drafts the Admin has created and helps shuffle people with her deep knowledge of the field staff skills, personalities, plants and FBO’s.
*   Must balance the needs of available staff with travel and accommodation costs if moving them around a lot (SDP absorbed cost).
*   May provide a ‘standby’ service of casual MHI’s to absorb last minute gaps.
*   Supports the Admin in communicating out the rota to audience who need to see it and in fielding change requests after completion (modifying up to 4-5 versions in a typical week).
*   Preparing staff for the places they need to be, at what time, and tasks they’ll be completing.

### Key Persona Pain Points

*   Variable adherence by different ITL’s to standard workflows, documentation and contractual agreements (e.g. variable rota formats, max 25% leave, 7 day rota notice, 48hr notice changes used for non-emergencies). 
*   Having to chase/manage some ITL’s much more than others.
*   Poor future visibility of FSA staffing levels (regularly as little as 1 week notice for planned absence).
*   Approving her contractors Annual Leave without visibility of FSA requirements that week.
*   Coordinating the needs of different people and clusters at the FSA who aren’t always aware of the overlap / each other (roles are not mapped 1:1)
*   Would like a more involved role when SOR’s are being reviewed or changed between the FBO and ITL.
*   Would rather be a true partner to the FSA’s ITL’s, than pure fulfillment (proactive instead of always reactive).
