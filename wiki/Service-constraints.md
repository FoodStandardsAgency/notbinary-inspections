## Understand service constraints
Service constraints are factors that should be taken into consideration when designing, operating and improving workplace planning for meat plant inspections.

Constraints are not necessarily roadblocks or reasons not to do things; they provide a way to recognise concerns, potential clashes of interest, technical and process-related issues, and other factors that could prevent the service from being fully successful.

They enable a service team to either find ways to remove or reduce the constraint, or build an acceptance that there will be limitations to what the service can achieve.

Constraints could be:
* **Known knowns** - Things we know will have an impact and can clearly define.
* **Known unknowns** - Things we know will have an impact but can't clearly define at the moment.

## Identified service constraints
The following constraints in the service lifecycle have been identified:

Stage        | Activity           | Constraint  |  
| :--------- |:-------------------| :-----------|
| Manage legislation, policy & business rules | Define FSA policy & procedures |  Policy and process change may require the revision of government regulations and significantly extended timescales for implementation.|


Service Analysis  |  
| :--------- |
Legislation cannot be changed in the short-term and is not a viable way of driving continuous improvement. 
Policy and business rule revisions at the FSA level could, and are, undertaken where required. These must be interpreted and communicated to field operations and those involved in meat plant inspections in a way that avoids ambiguity and misunderstanding. 
Where appropriate, business rules could be incorporated into systems and applications to drive consistency in working practices. This is not currently the case with the SOR application (although guidance documentation is produced), or rotas which are managed and maintained in Microsoft Excel.  |

Stage        | Activity           | Constraint  |  
| :--------- |:-------------------| :-----------|
| Manage legislation, policy & business rules | Define FSA policy & procedures      | Policy, process and procedure change requires engagement with the relevant industry bodies and consensus on any revisions.  | 

Service Analysis  |  
| :--------- |
Changes to policy, process and procedures can be achieved in a shorter timeframe than updating legislation. It is still not a simple undertaking as multiple industry bodies and/or stakeholders must be involved. 
At an everyday implementation level, working practices can be revised by Field Operations, working with the Service Delivery Partner(s) and other internal teams as required. This level affords the greatest opportunity to refine the ways of working and drive consistency within the existing legal and policy constraints. 
Technology and tools should enable best practice where possible. Currently, the SOR and rota tools encourage different ways of working and the different interpretation and input of information.   |

Stage        | Activity           | Constraint  |  
| :--------- |:-------------------| :-----------|
|Define resourcing requirements  | Assess meat plant operations|Dependence on ITL/OV experience. Lack of central reference guidelines.     | 

Service Analysis  |  
| :--------- |
This is a manual task that relies on ITL experience and knowledge, supported by an OV, to visit the plant, define the required number of inspection points, and level of resourcing to fulfill those inspection points to support the Food Business Operator's intended level of production. 
Much of the knowledge for this activity is learnt on the job and peer-to-peer.|

Stage        | Activity           | Constraint  | 
| :--------- |:-------------------| :-----------|
|Document inspection plan | Create or change Statement of Resources| Current SOR data capture and format creates ambiguity downstream.    | 

Service Analysis  |  
| :--------- |
The SOR is essentially the place for FBOs to advise the FSA of their production times and ways of working. It incorporates plant and resource requirements information that can be comprehensive and complex depending on the plant. 
The Statement of Resource Guidance document provides some context and information for the SOR. 
The SOR application itself, however, coupled with a dependence on peer-to-peer learning, does not enable ITLs to create or change a SOR intuitively. 
Some business critical information is not captured at all (e.g. number of inspection points). 
Some fields are ambiguous and open to interpretation, and as a result are being used inconsistently (e.g. 'start' and 'end' times) which is reducing the confidence people have in the SOR as a business tool for activities such as timesheet validation and charging query investigation. The SOR cannot be relied upon as a single source of truth, and needs further checking with the ITL. 
Further, the business rules around when to change the SOR are being applied inconsistently making it harder to maintain a true audit trail. 
Complexity of the data and perceived clunkiness of the system means many ITLs find it easier to start a new SOR than updating an existing one. This means there is no true audit trail for SORs or the changing resourcing requirements of the FBO.
In theory all SORs should be printed and signed off. This means there are paper and online copies of any one SOR. Paper copies tend to be stored by the ITL but storage approaches varies between each ITL. 
Retention of both paper and online versions of SORs is not clearly defined and different approaches are followed. Paper and online information is being retained and/or destroyed based on individual rather than organisation-wide, consistent standards. |

Stage        | Activity           | Constraint  |  
| :--------- |:-------------------| :-----------|
|Agree inspection plan  | Manage appeal against SOR | n/a    | n/a    |

Service Analysis  |  
| :--------- |
There is a clearly-defined and comprehensive, two-stage appeal process for FBOs who do not agree with the Statement of Resources proposed for their plant. Where a disagreement over resourcing cannot be resolved, the FSA will implement the required inspection points to enable the plant to operate within the regulations. The appeal process is outside the direct scope of this discovery, other than where information contained in the SOR needs to be referenced and understood to validate an appeal.

Stage        | Activity           | Constraint  |  
| :--------- |:-------------------| :-----------|
|Organise resources  | Allocate staff to meat plant inspection| Desire for blended teams and staff flexibility creates inefficiencies.| 

Service Analysis  |  
| :--------- |
This is a manual task initiated by the ITL working in Excel. 
Local knowledge about the area, cluster and plants, along with personal knowledge of the meat hygiene inspectors in their team informs how the rota is put together. There is no central knowledge repository for managing this information. 
Business rules are in place to: cap staff on annual leave at any one time at 25%; 30 days notice for a major change to operations at a plant; seven day notice period for rota changes; two day notice period for emergency changes. 
These rules must be considered when compiling rotas but they are not baked into the rota spreadsheet and there is no notification when the rules apply or alert when they have been breached. 
It is known that these business rules are not being adhered to in practice and that meeting short-term resource requests is often delivered through goodwill on behalf of inspection staff and/or E&J.  |

Stage        | Activity           | Constraint  |  
| :--------- |:-------------------| :-----------|
Agree FSA/SDP staff deployment | Desire for blended teams and staff flexibility creates inefficiencies.| n/a|

Service Analysis  |  
| :--------- |
This is a manual task to confirm and agree the approach to deliver inspection services within an area, cluster and plant. Plans are usually built around the FSA's capacity to fulfill resourcing needs, with E&J providing contract resource for a full-time inspection point requirement or as backfill to cover FSA inspectors on flexible working patterns, as laid out in the SOR. 
The task is essentially a conversation but which refers to the SOR.  |

Stage        | Activity           | Constraint  |  
| :--------- |:-------------------| :-----------|
|Manage resourcing  | Manage weekly resourcing| Manual tools and processes. Distributed responsibility; local knowledge.| 

Service Analysis  |  
| :--------- |
A rota is prepared by the ITL for each week of FBO production. Rotas are created manually in Excel. 
The ITL populates the rota with available and appropriate FSA staff before passing the rota to Eville & Jones (E&J) via email. 
E&J receive at least one rota per ITL, but in reality receive an average two to four times that number due to revisions.
E&J Area Resource Managers and Resource Coordinators then assess the requirements for CMHIs, perform manual skill and plant matching (using their own plant and inspector profiles), and complete the spreadsheet. 
E&J resource coordinators support multiple ITLs and clusters across an area. Although some of the information required to support these tasks is available online, the tasks themselves are entirely manual and time-consuming. This work is performed every weekday by a dedicated team of four coordinators. 
Plant and staff profiles are created and maintained by E&J; this is not content that is provided centrally by the FSA meaning there is either duplication or a risk that useful information that supports FSA operations sits outside the FSA itself without counterpart information inside the FSA.
The main channel of communication is email, with phone as a backup. There is no automated notification between ITLs and ARMs when rotas are ready for review and no shared space to work on rotas collaboratively. 
Rotas are emailed as attachments both between the FSA and E&J and between the FSA and E&J and their respective staff, meaning there are actually many hundred instances of any one rota in existence in any one week.|

Stage        | Activity           | Constraint  |  
| :--------- |:-------------------| :-----------|
|Manage work done  | Review weekly timesheets| Time pressures; system availability; SOR usability.| 

Service Analysis  |  
| :--------- |
This is a largely manual information comparison activity undertaken by the ITL. 
Official guidelines are for 100% of timesheets to be checked but the reality is that time constraints and other pressures make this an unrealistic target. 
Timesheets should reflect the staff allocation and work assignment outlined in rotas, and work done should be within the working practices documented in the SOR. There is no automated way of comparing this information; the ITL must open all relevant documents and compare data manually.|

Stage        | Activity           | Constraint  |  
| :--------- |:-------------------| :-----------|
|Support SOR application  | Manage SOR application incidents| Local and individual ways of working. | 

Service Analysis  |  
| :--------- |
There are relatively few calls regarding K2/SOR application, particularly considering the number of meat plants and corresponding SORs that are in scope. 
Most issues relate to individual understanding and interpretation of business rules in compiling the SOR. 
There is a tendency to rely on peer-to-peer support. 
There is a lack of coordinated, central support portal or knowledge sharing platform, although MS Teams has been implemented with varying levels of adoption by individual ITLs. 
There is no collaboration platform for the FSA and SDP. |


***


Stage        | Activity           | Constraint  |  
| :--------- |:-------------------| :-----------|
|Support rota application  | Manage rota application incidents| Tooling and processes is heavily manual. Local and individual ways of working.| 

Service Analysis  |  
| :--------- |
All known support for rotas is peer-to-peer. 
The process of creating and maintaining rotas is entirely manual and although attempts have been made to introduce a standard Excel format, this has not been successful as ongoing local and individual ways of working have persisted and/or the standard template has been modified. 
There is no formal guidance or training for building rotas; knowledge is passed on between ITLs making it difficult to track any common problems or where wider knowledge sharing would be beneficial. 
Any technical issues are likely to be generic Windows/Microsoft Office ones.    |

Stage        | Activity           | Constraint  |  
| :--------- |:-------------------| :-----------|
|Support meat plant inspection staff  |  Provide on-the-job support| Lack of coordinated nationwide approach. Dependence on peer-to-peer support.| 

Service Analysis  |  
| :--------- |
The overriding approach to support is peer-to-peer. There is no central reference point for ITLs or inspection staff where knowledge can be shared although Microsoft Teams has been implemented (and is being used for local collaboration by some, but not all, ITLs). 
Induction materials are being produced in an ad hoc, on demand way by individual ITLs. There is no central support for the meat inspection roles, including ITLs and how they should approach tasks. 
Although in some respects this empowers ITLs to define best practice, the result is an overall lack of knowledge and skill sharing outside local silos and a dependence on peer support to resolve issues. 
This informal approach makes it almost impossible to identify recurring issues, potential training needs, or improvement opportunities, especially at a national, cross-area level.|


***


Stage        | Activity           | Constraint  |  
| :--------- |:-------------------| :-----------|
|Use meat plant inspection resourcing data|   Manage SOR accuracy| Lack of coordinated service-wide plan for reporting.| 

Service Analysis  |  
| :--------- |
Because there is no holistic, end-to-end service design or coordinated ownership of the component parts of the meat inspection service, reporting requirements, objectives, and use cases are not clearly defined. 
This has encouraged ad hoc requests for reports to be run in PowerBI which, while useful, could be improved by a joined-up reporting plan that serves a clear purpose and audience. 
The SOR accuracy report, for example, could be a more useful continuous improvement tool if the SOR was designed to capture additional information that enabled reporting at a more granular level such as activity code allocation.|


***


Stage        | Activity           | Constraint  |  
| :--------- |:-------------------| :-----------| 
| Use meat plant inspection resourcing data | Manage staff utilisation|  Lack of coordinated service-level plan for setting and tracking KPIs.| 

Service Analysis  |  
| :--------- |
Because there is no holistic, end-to-end service design or coordinated ownership of the component parts of the meat inspection service, there are no clearly defined KPIs that can be used to monitor how well the service is operating and how efficiently staff are deployed. Neither the SOR or rota can confirm easily how many inspection points there are in a plant or enable the calculation of a nationwide total. 
The format and way information is captured makes it difficult to confirm the number of staff required to inspect a plant and accommodate the FBOs production times, or the skill sets required. 
The SOR is seen as insufficient as a source of business planning information, leaving rotas as the most tangible source of deployment information albeit in a very manual and inconsistent format.|


***


Stage        | Activity           | Constraint  |  
| :--------- |:-------------------| :-----------|
| Use meat plant inspection resourcing data | Manage charging/payment complaint| SOR is not created with downstream user needs in mind.| 

Service Analysis  |  
| :--------- |
The SOR is essentially the place for FBOs to advise the FSA of their production times and ways of working. It incorporates information that also assists in managing charging and payment queries although the SOR wasn't designed with this specific audience in mind. 
Coupled with inconsistent interpretation of how to complete fields within the SOR, this means that information cannot be relied upon when needed to investigate charging problems, generating additional follow up work and a need to contact ITLs directly for clarification.    |

Stage        | Activity           | Constraint  | 
| :--------- |:-------------------| :-----------|
| Use meat plant inspection resourcing data | Manage debt recovery| SOR is not created with downstream user needs in mind.| 

Service Analysis  |  
| :--------- |
The SOR is essentially the place for FBOs to advise the FSA of their production times and ways of working. It incorporates information that also assists in managing the recovery of unpaid charges although the SOR wasn't designed with this specific audience in mind. 
Coupled with inconsistent interpretation of how to complete fields within the SOR, this means that information cannot be relied upon when needed to investigate charging problems, generating additional follow up work and a need to contact ITLs directly for clarification.    |
