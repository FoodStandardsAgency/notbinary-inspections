## Understand the stakeholder mapping
For each stakeholder, the mapping describes their role and influence on the service, and their objective or interest in ensuring the service operates successfully.

Note that the focus is on the resourcing part of the service, not the inspections service itself or other components of the service such as timesheeting which is dealt with elsewhere.
