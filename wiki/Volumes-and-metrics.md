## Understand volumes and metrics

There is no coordinated approach to gathering and producing metrics to support resourcing.

A number of reports are produced by different teams in Change and Business Implementation and Finance to support specific parts of the the field operations and charging processes, such as the SOR Accuracy Report and the Missing Timesheets Report. 

However, there is relatively little in the way of usable data for more rigorous analysis and there is a general lack of confidence in the data available where information originates in the SOR because there is inconsistency in the way it is created and maintained.

### Volumes & metrics - Statement of Resources

Baseline stats (sample stats November/December 2019)

Activity        | Data           | Statistic  | 
| :--------- |:-------------------|:------------------------:|
| Number of Statements of Resources| 1x SOR per approved plant | approx 900
| Number of in-date SORs| Reviewed within 0-6 months  | 77.14%
| Number of in-date SORs| Reviewed within 6-12 months | 18.93%
| Number of out-of-date SORs| Reviewed more than 12 months ago | 3.93%
| Number of accurate SORs| Estimated vs actual chargeable hours | 0.44%

Statistics that are not currently generated:
* Total number of inspection points within: a plant; a cluster; an area; or nationwide.
* Baseline number of actual staff needed to fulfill inspection points.
* Frequency of changes to individual SOR.
* Reason for change to individual SOR.

This has an impact on effective recruitment, skills development, operational planning and forecasting, business continuity, and succession planning.

Without this level of basic data, identifying the true cost of resourcing meat plant inspections is difficult, and modelling alternatives is all but impossible.

### Volumes and metrics - Rotas
Given the way rotas are managed and maintained (without a centralised system; a fully manual process; and large variation caused by local and individual ways of working) it is extremely difficult put together statistical data about rotas.

Baseline stats

Activity        | Data           | Statistic  | 
| :--------- |:-------------------|:------------------------:|
| Number of inspection staff available for work allocation per week| MHI, CMHI and OV  | 900+
| Typical number of FSA-produced inspector rotas per week| 1x rota per ITL | 33
| Typical number of SDP-produced inspector rotas per week| 1x rota per ITL  | 33
| Typical number of SDP-produced official vet rotas per week| 1x rota per ITL  | 33

The following analysis is based on a survey of 31 ITLs carried out in September 2019 by the SLA Team to gather information on managing changes to rotas:

Activity        | Metric           | Finding  | 
| :--------- |:-------------------|:------------------------:|
| Planning rotas in advance | 4 weeks | 17/31
|  | 3 weeks | 5/31
|  | 2 weeks | 4/31
|  | 1 weeks | 1/31
| Average no. of changes to rotas | 4+ | 8/31
|  | 3-4 | 5/31
|  | 1-2 | 18/31
| Reasons changes to rotas | Sickness | 28/31
|  | Short notice leave request | 27/31
|  | E&J no staff available | 13/31
|  | FBO resource requirement change | 12/31
|  | Staff needed for other tasks | 5/31
|  | Error or correction to rota | 4/31

These findings, along with the user research conducted during this discovery, show that the advance preparation of rotas is determined entirely by the ITL's individual ways of working and there is a lack of consistency into how far in advance workforce planning is occurring.

There is also a widespread sense that emergency leave requests are being misused to cover a range of activities, some of which such as training and personal reviews could be arranged ahead of time. These requests have the biggest impact on the ability to support flexible working and back-filling for sickness etc.

It should be noted that although there is a baseline number of 33 rotas per week, these typically change twice before being implemented. The way that rotas are transferred between stakeholders via email means that for every change the number of rota documents in existence is multiplied by the number of changes multiplied by the number of email recipients.
Our user research found cases of rotas being changed up to eight times within a week.

### Staff utilisation (October 2019)
The following figures show contract staff utilisation, and were provided by Eville & Jones.

Team        | Metric           | Finding  | 
| :--------- |:-------------------|:------------------------:|
| Official Veterinarians | No. of AVM | 14 (all qualified OVs)
|  | No. of OV | 288
|  | No. of OV required as FTE at 100% utilisation | 255
|  | Utilisation | 88%
| Meat Hygiene Inspectors | No. of ARM | 14 (9 OVs, 5 MHI)
|  | No. of VMHI | 80
|  | No. of MHI | 209 (non-vet)
|  | No. of MHI required as FTE at 100% utilisation | 274
|  | Utilisation | 95%

The Discovery research suggests that 100% utilisation is not possible if the flexibility required for FSA staff cover is to be accommodated.
