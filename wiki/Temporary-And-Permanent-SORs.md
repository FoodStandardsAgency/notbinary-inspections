There will always be a main SOR. This is the permanent, day-to-day statement of resources and should be reviewed every 6 months to a year. Throughout this time there may be periods where the FBO wishing to increase their production output, for example during religious holidays. In this case we are proposing the option to create a new but temporary SOR to cover a set period. When creating the SOR the user will have the option to set it as a temporary change, and set the review date to be a point in the future.

Once this time approaches the SOR will be switched over to the new SOR. 
When the end date gets closer the user will be notified that they need to review the SOR with the FBO and decide if they want to keep using it, change it, or revert to the main SOR.

The temporary SORs will serve another purpose - allowing users to essentially create template SORs. For example, an ITL creates a temporary SOR for Christmas 2019. When the period for Christmas 2020 comes around they can easily create a new copy based off this 2019 SOR. 

The naming of temporary SORs will lend itself to this process and provide a neater display for the user. The permanent SOR should always be called something like "Primary" or "Main" and on the overview screen should be made clear to the user. The current temporary SOR should also be grouped with the main SOR and clearer indicated that it is "Live".
