## Research Methods

At the project outset, with the help of subject matter experts from the FSA Operational Change Team, we identified the key primary users of SOR and Rotas tools. We also identified a long-list of additional users who can be classed as either collaborators in their use of the tools or consumers of their outputs.


These can be seen [summarised here](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/users-and-stakeholders#user-segments) 

*  SOR and Rota Creators were prioritised for research
*  Rota Collaborators were also consulted

We conducted a total of 14 depth 1 on 1 remote interviews.  

10 with Rota and SOR creators;
* 6 with Inspection Team Leaders
* 4 with Area Managers

4 with Rota collaborators and SOR consumers;
* 3 Service Delivery Partner (Area Resourcing Manager) interviews 
* 1 Service Delivery Partner Head Office Administrator interview

### Method

The method was depth 1 on 1 remote interviews.

## About Personas

Personas are behavioural archetypes that illustrate fictional individuals from key user segments. They are evidence driven, combining insights from across all research participants within a segment and are not a representation of any one individual.

Design Personas capture;
* Personal profile, role, attitudes and behaviours.
* Tools, skills and context of use.
* Tasks, motivations and goals.
* Key pain points and barriers with the task, tool or service

Personas are intended as a design tool and reference point, to support and inform a user centric approach to solving key service challenges. By keeping the attributes of different audience groups visible and front of mind, the design and service team can ensure they remain focused on end user realities and goals. They inform and support reflective critique of work in progress (designs or builds).

They should evolve as the project progresses and more is learned about each one and further sub-personaâ€™s may emerge.
