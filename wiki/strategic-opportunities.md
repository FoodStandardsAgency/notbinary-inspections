The key strategic opportunity for SOR and Rotas is for these to become integral parts of an overall Inspections service.

Shifting perspective from a collection of related systems and processes to one of a holistic service delivered collaboratively by a collection of organisations, people, processes and systems in service of an overall objective, provides an attractive step forward in the development of the service delivered by FSA as an organisation.

Key technology principles that underpin this shift include:

 * An API-led approach: enabling automated collaboration between systems so data can be held once authoritatively and be accessed and reused across the service, as well as made available to SDP(s) where appropriate (and/or where data can be openly published)
 * Selecting multi-disciplinary collaboration as a key underlying principle (or "intent") for the design of the inspections service enables convergent independent decision-making for systems and processes development, ensuring a consistent overall service and enabling each component to be evaluated for alignment to this principle

The following principles are also recommended for making strategic use of technology in order to progress as an organisation:

 * A design principle of working in the open (by default) enables increased transparency across FSA, SDP(s) and the public, whilst also minimising friction and barriers to integration and collaboration across the inspections service, the wider organisation and third parties. Openness supports efficiency, accountability and trust.
 * Ensuring technology design is (by default) aligned to current (and evolving) Government Digital and public cloud/wider industry practice will ensure value can be delivered from FSA's investment in adopting public cloud infrastructure.
