Prototyping builds on what we learn during the early user research and service analysis of a Discovery. It is a means to 
* explore new approaches
* challenge the way things are done
* test riskiest assumptions

During discovery this is less about designing what a final solution might be, but more to allow us to surface implicit needs and test understanding and expectation. 

For Statements of Resource, we have explored two types of prototypes, or sketches: 
1. [Application programming interfaces](reference-data-apis)
2. [User interfaces](sor-user-interface)

Outputs are not intended to be used in a production context, but can inform alpha development. They are also not complete, but focus on priority use cases or scenarios.
