These recommendations should be considered in light of the approaches set out by [discovery learnings](learnings-and-actions) and suggested [technology strategy](technology-recommendations): 
1. [Go back to basics with Statements of Resource](#statements-of-resource)
2. [Co-design a single shared Rota owned by the FSA](#rota)
3. [Review FBO interactions with the Inspections Service](#inspections-service)

## Statements of Resource

***Go back to basics with Statements of Resource***

1. Define new, clear and authoritative guidance based on service goals
2. Re-focus for plant profiling and resource modelling information
3. Test data-driven prototypes for entry and output user experience

### Goals

Be able to answer the question *"how many people do we need?”*

- Capture data relevant for resource modelling
- Build up plant profiles
- Improve consistency of use

### Constraints

* Ingrained habits and interpretations 
* SOR accuracy monitoring

### Priorities

**Improve the user experience**

- Simplify the **logical flow and scope of data entry**, focussing on plant and operational information needed to determine the resourcing requirements for a plant
- Improve **system usability** to make user interactions consistent, modern and accessible, and to improve the presentation and readability of complex data
- **Automate options** based on business rules and re-use of data from across the FSA's data pool
- **Standardise SOR completion** and handoff, including distribution and storage, versioning and presentation of outputs suitable for different audiences and use cases

**Define new guidance**

- Re-focus around **service goals and SOR priorities** for resource modelling
- Define clear **actionable checklists** for SOR review and completion
- Undertake content design to **clarify language** and ensure consistency for system labelling and contextual help 

## Rota

***Co-design a single shared Rota owned by the FSA***

1. Undertake cross-partner service design to build shared approach
2. Test cultural and organisational challenges to shared system use

### Goals 

*“right people, place, time”*

* Improve visibility of resourcing factors

* Reduce handoffs (and risks to delays and miscommunication)

* Improved adherence to service level and operational commitments (such as )

### Constraints 

* Disclosure of personnel and operational data may require data sharing agreements

* Risk of personnel solicitation (across agency and workforce supply partners)
* Timeframes for handling change request

### Priorities

Establish **rules of engagement** 

* Review and baseline operating process and practice, including delivery expectations, leadtimes and cutoffs
* Undertake service design review with Field Ops leaders and service delivery partner(s) to establish common goals, constraints 
* Identify opportunities for closer service alignment and potential friction

**Prototype and pilot** rota solutions to test 

- Secure trusted access across supply chain
- Co-authoring single source of truth (eg, including access privileges, editorial permissions, change approval workflow)
- ‘Zoom’ filters or views to appropriate levels for different creators, collaborators or consumers (eg, person, plant, cluster, area, region, national views)
- Data exchange (eg, with iTrent, SOR, TS, SDP tools)

## Inspections Service

***Review FBO interactions with Inspections Service***

1. Expand end-to-end Inspection service picture across supply chain
2. Revisit early stage Inspections service activity in light of SOR, rota and timesheeting discovery analysis

### Goals 

*"Align service and customers"* from the start of the relationship

* Examine how FBO relationship management and touchpoints align with Inspections service

* Identify data re-use and automation opportunities

### Constraints 

* External dependency on FBOs may limit access for discovery

* Volume and frequency of approval requests

### Priorities

**Carry out Discovery** to 

* unpack how FBO Approvals are carried out, registered and reviewed

* revisit Approvals process as service entry point and feeder to SOR

* examine data integration opportunities for Inspections, including with Establishments & People
