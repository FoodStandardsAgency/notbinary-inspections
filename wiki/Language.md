We discovered a problem around the labelling in the SOR tool. Things like start and end times are stated without any further context.

We have looked at improving the labelling through the system and this was met positively. Adding the word "estimate" to the line speed and daily throughput could have a very good impact on all productivity. 

Our introduction of the premesis open and close times still confused users and so would need to be addressed further during alpha. If the idea of why this information (giving a context) was given to ITLs, this would help this problem.
