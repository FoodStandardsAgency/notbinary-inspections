## What was the initial problem you were asked to look into?

**Team score**: **Met**/Partially met/Did not meet


### Context

Discovery work on Timesheeting indicated there could be an opportunity for Field Ops resourcing tools to work better together to support improved meat plant inspections through

*   re-use of data 
*   reducing manual overheads 
*   standardising approaches to Field Ops workforce management

The key tools (Statements of Resource and Field Ops rotas) are currently used inconsistently and are not considered to be technically robust enough to integrate with the timesheeting system. 

This discovery examines their potential and limitations to help drive efficient and accurate data processing for charging, payments and operational delivery. 


### **Size of problem**

Meat Plant Inspections are carried out at ~900 Food Business Operator (FBO) establishments across England & Wales by ~800 staff and contract personnel.

The FBOs are distributed across 33 FSA operational clusters, each of which is managed by an Inspection Team Leader (ITL). 

Each ITL develops, maintains and reviews (at least once annually) a Statement of Resource (SOR) for each establishment in their cluster, setting out expected inspection resourcing requirements that the FSA will deliver (and charge) against. 

Each of the 33 ITLs maintains their own staffing rota for their cluster of establishments, and together may make ~100 rota updates each week. A Service Delivery Partner maintains their own suite of rotas to allocate contract staff and coordinate FSA worker requests and rota changes, which are handled by 18 Resource Managers and Administrators nationally. 


### **Team observations**


#### **Something the team did well**

We looked at current and historic tools and output to get a better context of how rotas and SORs developed, and the kinds of problems users were trying to solve with them. This helped reveal implicit and assumed user needs, as well as some of the cultural and behavioural challenges that could be met in a subsequent change programme. We also focussed on the people who have the most input to those systems for our research while appreciating there are other stakeholders.


#### **Something the team has learnt**

User expectations are framed by the tools they are using and how they have learnt how to use them. The tools in play have evolved ‘organically’ to perform several non-core jobs (such as rotas as a job instruction tool). Conflating multiple functions has created a complexity to the service and perceived needs. Existing guidance is insufficient and ambiguous, which is encouraging inconsistent ways of working. Prototyping - ‘showing the thing’ - has been invaluable to test and challenge mixed assumptions and learned behaviours that user research has surfaced.  


#### **Possible gaps**

The team has gathered input and perspectives from a range of individual user segments and stakeholders, from which we can define service wide pain points and opportunities. We’ve done this across the stakeholder community, but not been able to bring all stakeholders together at the same time to test shared or common understanding of service-wide goals and constraints, and where or why differences may exist. A service blueprint review has only been possible with internal stakeholders, rather than supply chain partners, but has validated findings so far. 


#### **Reflections/recommendations**

Recurring themes emerged quickly once user interviews began. There’s a fine balance between re-validation and capturing enough to move discovery forward. Prototyping / sketching could have begun earlier to test findings and implicit assumptions, creating space for broader or deeper user segment research. 


## **Identify all of the types of users, including those who may not be able to use a digital service.**

_The team should have a good understanding of user needs, understand what users are trying to do when they engage with the current service._

**Team score**: **Met**/Partially met/Did not meet


#### **Something the team did well**

The team quickly identified and engaged internal and external stakeholders. We consulted broadly to build a rounded picture of needs, while focussing deeper research on the users of the core service components where pain points and opportunity could be best addressed. We built trust with the service delivery partner early which helped to illicit valuable insights about the impacts of internal practice across the supply chain. 


#### **Something the team has learnt**

There are a number of creators, contributors and consumers to the resourcing tools suite, both internal and external to the FSA. Current service provision is disjointed and heavily skewed towards manual processes, with multiple handoffs that create delay and potential error. Resourcing decisions often need to be made and communicated at short notice. Stakeholders have partial context and visibility of resourcing parameters, which creates friction in the decision process. There’s no defined way of working or single truth to discover, which has left a lot to unpick and corroborate during the discovery process.


#### **Possible gaps**

Food Business Operators are direct stakeholders in Statements of Resources. Frontline staff provide input to rota development, and receive weekly scheduling outputs. While we can infer some of their experiences and pain points from other user research, it was not possible to engage either of these user segments in the timeframe.

The Service Delivery Partner contract is currently being re-tendered. While we have abstracted current (as-is) SDP needs, new partner (or partners) may have different operating circumstances and constraints. 


#### **Reflections/recommendations**

The business operating model relies on third parties to ensure a flexible workforce to fulfil resourcing needs. External views are important to fill out the context and avoid internal bias. Engage these stakeholders early. Cleaning up existing processes before new SDPs come on board can help avoid making an already complex way of working even more complicated.


## **Understand the strengths and weaknesses of their experience today and develop hypotheses about what an ideal service would do**

**Team score**: **Met**/Partially met/Did not meet


#### **Something the team did well**

The team built on the experience of timesheeting to understand how resourcing fits into the end-to-end inspection service. This has helped bring clarity to what the service and supporting tools are about, cutting through conflated system purposes and considering multiple user perspectives. 

This context has helped shape what we test through prototyping. For example, this has helped improve the way information is organised to help users to focus on the meat plant rather than other factors that currently cloud the process when developing an SOR (such as discounts, charges and specific staff). 


#### **Something the team has learnt**

Inspection resourcing isn’t really a coherent service - it’s more a collection of localised activities that happen by different people (and organisations) with brittle handoffs and interfaces, and lots of duplicated and orphaned data. 

Field Ops is rich with localised problem solving and innovation. There's strong self-reliance with homegrown tools to manage the immediate operational priorities. With that, however, is arguably a detachment from the FSA's wider service provision and processes, and the risk of losing sight of the big picture. 


#### **Possible gaps**

The prototyping phase of this discovery focused on testing SOR hypotheses. A number of hypotheses and risks/constraints have been identified for rota management, but these have not yet been tested due to time and capacity. 


#### **Reflections/recommendations**

The service delivery partner has some good practice and experience that the FSA can learn from, as well as useful knowledge that does not exist within the agency. While the FSA owns the service, supply chain partners have a stake and can contribute greatly to better, holistic service design that will benefit all. 

The service delivery contract is soon to be renewed, and the FSA should involve the contract winner(s) in further service development early. There is value in the FSA baselining their processes and best practice first to build on with incoming SDP(s), in order to keep service focus and clarity.`


## **Identify the key business challenges and the type of improvements that are possible**

_For example: cost savings, customer satisfaction improvements_

**Team score**: **Met**/Partially met/Did not meet


#### **Something the team did well**

The team has dived into the detail of resourcing tools and practice, but maintained a service-wide view of meat plant inspections, which is not commonly held by individual siloed user segments. This joined-up perspective has helped us identify and communicate ways to simplify and bring focus to how resourcing is managed, and to test some of these ideas with stakeholders through playbacks and prototyping. 


#### **Something the team has learnt**

Inspections resourcing is an inherently complex business problem, but in the FSA is further complicated by organisational culture and processes. Systemic and behavioural factors have a direct impact on the service and user journeys, and these are going to be harder to address than buying or building a technical solution, which could be undermined if not supported by process improvement groundwork. 


#### **Possible gaps**

Metrics are not well defined, partly because the resourcing process is a disjointed set of activities. A lot of information and data is being captured across all user groups but it feels like lots of individual fields being filled in for individual users to do standalone jobs. 

Disparate, unconnected data that is not available for systems to access reinforces localised service provision, and makes it harder to build an automated reporting process that can help show the bigger picture. Collating and analysing this across ITLs, SORs and rotas to identify trends would need more time than has been available in this discovery.


#### **Reflections/recommendations**

If “what you get is what you measure” better service-wide metrics can help re-train organisational behaviours to fashion a more connected service. Re-mapping the desirable end-to-end resourcing process will help identify what data is needed to manage the service, where to logically capture it, and make sure that reports are purposeful, actionable and useful to measure and manage delivery outcomes. Doing this across service stakeholders can build consensus and trust in data outputs.


## **Identify key areas of focus for the next phase of work**

_For example: a part of the customer journey that is causing particular pain, or a part of the business process that could be easily automated_

**Team score**: **Met**/Partially met/Did not meet


#### **Something the team did well**

The team explored both rotas and SOR broadly during the research phase of discovery, but switched focus to deep dive into SOR for the prototyping phase. Rota management (and getting people to the right place at the right time) is a common problem space with a mature product market that the FSA can leverage. SOR, however, is bespoke to the FSA and has unique problems, goals and service impact. We focussed on this to provide more value and make better use of time and capacity.


#### **Something the team has learnt**

Inspection resourcing is not so much a technology challenge for the FSA, as a service design issue. The current resourcing tools are effectively homegrown within Field Ops. They’ve evolved locally (both in scope and geographically) rather than having been intentionally designed with wider service considerations. ITLs are empowered to resolve issues as they need, but that results in a lack of consistency, coherence and reusability.


#### **Possible gaps**

Statements of Resource feed into rotas, and both input to the delivery of inspection operations, of which Timesheeting is an output. Approval and registration of FBOs should be an important input for SOR, particularly when building up plant profiles upon which resourcing and forecasting calculations are made. There is more to explore around this initial stage of the overall inspection service.


#### **Reflections/recommendations**

Technology can support and enable the behavioural and structural change that is needed to sustain improvements to inspection resourcing, but what the shape of that change should be needs to be collaboratively and intentionally designed before buying or building a system to fix it. 

This process has to be user-driven, and users need to be involved in that journey from the outset in order to change deeply ingrained ways of working that may need to be shifted. FSA Digital has an opportunity to facilitate a user-centred approach from a servant leadership rather than an expert position.


## **Align stakeholders around the definition of the problem and recommendations**

**Team score**: **Met**/Partially met/Did not meet


#### **Something the team did well**

The team work openly and transparently, combining weekly show and tell sessions and weeknotes to playback understanding of the problem and emergent findings, and to solicit feedback and challenge. We carry out walkthroughs of work-in-progress (such as user  mappings, service blueprint and prototypes) with the product owner and other stakeholders. This helps build alignment and consensus around what the problem is and potential recommendations as the discovery progresses. 


#### **Something the team has learnt**

A service blueprint review is invaluable to get different stakeholder groups together and zoom out to the big picture. Each user segment has their own concerns and focus but a cross-discipline session can help build empathy and shared understanding. Similarly, paper prototyping seems to have really helped people envisage why things are problematic and how they could be different.


#### **Possible gaps**

While the discovery process has helped bring different stakeholders together and get alignment for the need for and nature of change, there is no clear service owner for the full end-to-end meat plant inspection, of which resourcing is one component. This confuses who can lead and drive the changes or transformation that is needed to deliver the business outcomes at a strategic level, and encourages isolated one-to-one conversations (eg, for ad-hoc report requests) at an operational level. 


#### **Reflections/recommendations**

Having a consistent physical workspace, and being able to keep work-in-progress up on walls has been invaluable for stakeholders to drop in and see how thinking is evolving. That has helped with talking through our ‘workings’ in more depth with individual stakeholder groups where it’s not been possible or appropriate to elaborate in time-limited Show & Tell sessions.

## **Demonstrate how the team has worked together using agile methods and the learning from this**

**Team score**: **Met**/Partially met/Did not meet


#### **Something the team did well**

The blended team (including Notbinary and FSA people) has used standups, stand downs, retrospectives and show and tells to focus each sprint and share insight. The PO and Change Managers consistent participation has helped ensure good sense-checking and timely decision support. Ceremonies have been adapted where needed to help the team work better in an agile way and to deliver at pace. 


#### **Something the team has learnt**

Prototyping is a valuable form of research, especially when trying to unpick ingrained, implicit or ‘local knowledge’. During discovery, sketches serve an investigative purpose, rather than necessarily to design what a system will look like or how it might behave. This is worth bearing in mind when translating discovery prototypes to alpha. 


#### **Possible gaps**

The whole team - and especially research, analysis and design workstreams - have all participated in early stage user interviews, quickly building up shared knowledge and understanding. With the double scope of the discovery, this has been intense and produced a split-focus cognitive overhead. There’s been little opportunity to pause, reflect, and to have the decompression conversations needed to unravel some of the tangle. 


#### **Reflections/recommendations**

We have a better understanding of what the sprint goals, schedule and sequence for a comparable discovery would be, and what this means for managing deliverable outputs and workstream dependencies. This should help to get a better balance of how each workstream owner is involved in research at different stages of discovery, and create more space for the conversations that can lead to better insights.
