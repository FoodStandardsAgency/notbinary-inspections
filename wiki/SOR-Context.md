Statements of Resource (SOR) are established for each Food Business Operator (FBO) establishment or site at which the FSA carries out inspection controls. 

Each Statement captures the **weekly resourcing profile, attendance pattern and chargeable activity expected** of FSA staff and contractors, based on a siteâ€™s forecast volume and schedule of business activity. 

- The **FSA use SORs** to support resource planning for Field Operations, including staffing rotas and contractor provisioning.  
- The **FBOs use SORs** for financial planning, based on the expected cost of chargeable inspection work. 

While the SOR frames what chargeable activity is expected, the Timesheeting system is used to capture what activity is actually done day-to-day, and against which charges and payments are raised.
