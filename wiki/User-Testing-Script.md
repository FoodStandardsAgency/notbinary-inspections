### Intro
Thank you for agreeing to participate in this feedback session.

To give you a bit of a background as to what we’re doing: 
As you know, the FSA is undertaking a project to review the current tools used for SOR creation for plants. At the moment we are embarking on a process to explore some ideas about how we can improve the current service for users based on the feedback we have received to date.

I am looking at the design side of things with regards to this project. And today I’ll be showing you some early sketches about where we think an updated SOR could go.

We’ve found three areas for improvement with the SOR:
- Looking up SORs for editing/viewing/printing
- The data entry - the actual editing or creating of a new SOR.
- Distribution of the SOR and how this could feed into rota creation

In this session we will be looking at the data entry portion of the SOR. At this early stage of design I’m really interested in hearing your thoughts about entering the FBO’s information and around some of the inputs that we think could benefit from being automated which I’ll get to in this session.

Your feedback is really important and we want you to be as honest as you can. There are no wrong answers and everything you say will be taken onboard. So feel free to voice any opinions and concerns about what you have seen. Especially in the context of how your work and would like to work. 
If anything isn’t clear please do ask, it can be quite difficult to understand how things could work on a computer when looking at bits of paper.
This is just a prototype so nothing is set in stone. At this stage we’re really looking to see if we are heading in the right direction.

I would like to record the session so that the session can be analysed and the results fed back into the design of the service. Your feedback will be anonymised and the recording will be of just your voice and your screen.

If you have any question you can email me at [email]

### Background questions
- How often do you go in and edit SORs at the moment?
- If you could change anything with this process of editing an SOR, what would it be?

### Prototype intro
In most cases it seems that people are not really needing to create brand new SORs when there is a change, and so the focus is on editing an existing SOR to reflect a busier period, like the run up to Christmas or another religious holiday.

Do you have any questions at this stage around this or what we are attempting to achieve?

The first step is to select the SOR that you want to edit. At the moment when you look up the SOR there isn’t a prompt or any list of approval numbers. 
Do you write these numbers down anywhere yourself or do you just recall from memory when it comes to searching for it?
- If we could make them available on the page, do you think a list of approval numbers would be helpful for yourself?
- What about newer ITLs and AMs?

[Run through of SOR prototype]

1. We’ve had the idea to add a name to the SOR, do you think this could help when it comes to looking for a specific version?
  We would include the name in the table of search results, so you could name this one “Christmas temporary SOR” for example, this could then be shown in the table of SORs under the searched for approval number.


2. We have taken away the need to enter anything for the discount text box as when we were talking to other ITLs it seemed like this was something that finance would fill in generally.


3. We have added this switch to indicate if the SOR is to be a temporary change or an update to the permanent version. This could be thought of like the button on your clock when you set summer time.
We are looking to change the end date in this case to be a date of review rather than a definitive date the SOR will end.

4. We have identified a problem that a lot of ITLs seem to face when it comes to marking the hours for the week against activities to be done. We think we can have a visual aid to make this a bit easier.

5. Another change we think we put in is to have the computer work out if the FBO should be charged for overtime. 
We know there are specific rules (and quite a lot of them) when it comes to calculating this, for example working unsociable hours. But we could take these rules and write some computer programming to work this out. The idea being that once you have gone through and entered all the other details for the SOR like line speed, species and everything, that the system could then perform some calculations and notify you that there will likely be overtime involved. 
  - Does how I’ve explained that make sense?
  - Do you think it would be useful?
