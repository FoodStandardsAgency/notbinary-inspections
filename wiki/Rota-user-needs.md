## Rota user segments

Three key [User Segments](users-and-stakeholders#user-segments) were identified as key users (creators or collaborators) of the rota system and its outputs.

* Inspection Team Leaders
* Area Managers
* Area Resource Managers (Service Delivery Partner)

## Rota personas

Data collected through in-depth one-on-one research interviews was used to compile representative user personas. These capture the essential information about these users, their roles, needs, goals, and specific pain points in the rota creation or collaboration process.

To learn more about Persona’s and their role in user centred design read about them [here](user-research#about-personas).

## **Rota User Needs**
### ITL Personas - Graham & Nathan

See Needs in context of the [Rota User Journey Map](rota-user-journey).
#### Advance Preparation

*   I need to maintain a medium term future view of staffing levels, with known absence personnel changes recorded
*   I need to coordinate with the SDP on mid-term planning to ensure sufficient inspection staff coverage during recurring busy periods
*   I need to maintain a rota template that reflects current FBO working patterns and current MHI staff names and contracts
#### Data input
*   I need to allocate a sufficient total number of inspection staff to each food business so that they can operate within regulation
*   I need to allocate my staff in a manner that is financially efficient for the FSA and the FBO
*   I need to provide my staff with reasonable shift times and locations that reasonably meet their contractual and personal needs
*   I need to build a rota that accurately incorporates all potential sources of week to week variations in staff availability
*   I need to provide the various audiences of the rota with sufficient indicators of what will happen on each day in each place so that they can do the task, record it or allocate the right skills
#### Collaboration
*   I need to communicate my request for contract resource to the SDP in a way that clearly indicates how many, where and when
*   I need to maintain and navigate a file storage system of rotas in various states of completion
*   I need to share large amounts of data regularly with individuals outside of the FSA
*   I need a quick, efficient and accurate way of communicating and collaborating  with the service delivery partner
*   I need to be able to efficiently remedy a short notice change as soon as possible without communication overlap
*   I need to be able to clearly track a large volume of changes in a short space of time without error or confusion
*   I need to share or handover my rota plans to other ITLs or AM's in my absence
#### Distribution
*   I need to contact and distribute information to a wide set of people which can vary week by week
*   I need to reliably reach staff who have varying levels of technical literacy / access
*   I need a single authoritative 'source of truth' during the entire period of planning of a rota
*   I need an authoritative 'version of events' (week as worked) for later reference, after the week has been worked
