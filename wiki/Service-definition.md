## Definition - what is inspection resourcing?

The FSA provides inspection services at meat plants to deliver controls required by EU and UK legislation. The FSA does this using a mix of full-time, contract and casual staff who work across designated areas of England and Wales.

Resourcing is organised by Inspection Team Leads (ITLs) from the FSA supported by Area Managers (AMs), and Area Resource and Area Veterinary Managers (ARMs and AVMs) from Eville & Jones (E&J), the incumbent Service Delivery Partner (SDP).

Resourcing is not a standalone service in itself; it is core part of delivering meat plant inspections.

## Mission
Resourcing is a key part in setting up the meat inspection service and charging process for success.

It depends on getting the right people with the right skills to the right place at the right time.

The challenge is ensuring that happens as efficiently and effectively as possible to avoid preventing a plant from operating and wasting time and resource on non-productive activities.

## Vision
Earlier in the year, a discovery team from Notbinary looked at how inspection activity is logged in timesheets so that:

* work done is correctly charged to either the food business or the Government; 
* the Service Delivery Partner gets paid for the work their vets and inspectors have carried out; and 
* FSA inspectors get paid for any allowances above and beyond their salary.

Timesheeting is not the only part of delivering inspections. The process involves a whole sequence of planning, field operations and follow up work that involves people in a range of teams and job roles.

A big part of that process is 

- deciding how many inspection points are needed in each plant; 
- working out how many inspectors and vets are needed to allow the plant to operate its proposed production hours; and 
- organising inspection teams so that the right people turn up in the right place at the right time. 

Only with these things in place, can we start to ensure the right information enters the charging and payment processes and can be validated.

We identified Statements of Resource (SORs) and rotas as being important links in the flow of information that inform timesheets and the inspection work done at each plant.

The vision of this discovery is to investigate ways to:
* Remove or reduce the friction between the processes and activities, and the data and information that go into meat plant inspections, from the time a plant is assessed, through the inspection work done in plant, and on to charging and payments.
* Deliver more relevant and timely data that would enable better planning and operational efficiencies.
* Enable meat plant inspections to evolve as a user-focused, design-led service.

## Goals
A successful outcome of improved resourcing include:
* Greater ability for forward planning to underpin business continuity and succession planning.
* Improved workforce planning and work scheduling around regular known events such as holidays and festivals, and peaks and troughs in plant production.
* More efficient deployment of resource to minimise non-productive time, for example due to excessive travel between plants.

## Components of meat plant inspection resourcing
There are two key components that underpin resourcing for meat plant inspections:
* Statements of Resource - used to outline proposed workloads and anticipated volumes.
* Rotas - used to allocate people to plants and tasks to fulfill the obligation to inspect meat plant operations.

The information in SORs and rotas inform the the work that gets done in each plant, which is then recorded by inspection and veterinary staff in timesheets. 

We know from previous work that SORs, rotas and timesheets have not been designed as part of a holistic approach to inspections and, although some data is pulled between systems, a dependency on human input and disjointed processes undermines attempts at automating tasks and enabling people to do their jobs.
