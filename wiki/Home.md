This wiki documents research and [recommendations](recommendations) for the [**FSA Meat Plant Inspection Resourcing** service](definition). 

Findings are based on a [discovery](methodology) project carried out by [Notbinary](team) during [Nov-Dec 2019](timeline-and-ceremonies). 

The discovery [goal](scope) is to more fully understand

- the **limitations of the current resourcing tools** used to support the inspections service, and
- their **potential** to better enable the service

The resourcing tools in focus are [Statements of Resource](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/sor-context) and [rotas](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/rota-context).
