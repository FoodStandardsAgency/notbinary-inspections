## Concepts

### What we are testing for

Based on the pain points and opportunities I am able to identify areas of interest for prototyping. For the case of SORs, I decided to focus on the entering of data and distribution of completed SORs. Using the user journey maps created by the user research. The results of the user research inform where to look in the SOR for prototyping. We identify the "happy path" through the system that is, the path that is most likely for use (rather than taking edge cases into account). This is due to the discovery nature of the project, we are looking for areas to be addressed further during alpha phases etc. rather than solutions.

### User flows

Using the current flow as a starting point, we are able to map out how the user moves through the system in the context of completing the "happy path". The user flow is a process flow chart that maps the interaction points a user has with the system, including loops. During the first week of prototyping we have shared this with users and refined the flow. This then leads to hypotheses creation and paper prototyping.

### Hypotheses creation
Now that we have identified how a user flows through the system we can come up with ideas of where specifically we can make improvements. These hypotheses inform the paper prototypes and go into the script used during feedback sessions. An example is "We can automate discount calculations and remove the related textbox. This will make it easier for the user to complete an SOR as they do not need to perform mental calculations".
### Paper prototypes

The paper prototypes are the most valuable material for user feedback. The are literally sketches on A3 paper that can be quickly created. They are quick and dirty, this is a benefit as it allows users to not get attached to a particular design. They also convey the idea that this can be scrapped and so are more likely to give honest feedback about what they are seeing. We have found the best way to show these is during an in-person session.

### User feedback

We have used these sessions for to gather feedback on the user flows, however these sessions are best suited to paper prototypes as we can quickly put ideas in front of users and gather feedback. Then use this to iterate and so move towards a better solution. During this project the feedback sessions have ranged from 40-60 minutes with one or two users - any more than this can create problems and not facilitate a natural conversation. We carried these out via Skype and in-person with our Subject Matter Experts.

It is very important to plan these sessions and so we prepare a script of items to go through with users in order to maximise our time with them and keep the sessions focussed.

### Iterations

The user feedback allows iterations of the paper prototypes. This is a key part of the process and allows a more refined approach. It can quickly show things that are not working, and so we can "course correct" quickly.
