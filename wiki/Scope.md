## Opportunity

There is an operational link between [Statements of Resource](sor-context) (SOR), [rotas](rota-context) and [timesheeting](http://fsa-timesheeting.herokuapp.com/). 

SOR and rotas could drive more efficient and accurate timesheeting through
* re-use of data 
* reducing manual overheads 
* standardising approaches to Field Ops workforce management

This can help improve key components of the meat plant inspections service: 
* charging and payments
* service delivery review 
* contract management 

## Goals

The service re-design goal would be to enter and manage **timesheets by exception**. 

The discovery goal is to build on the recent Timesheeting Discovery to more fully understand
* the **limitations of the current resourcing tools** used to support the inspections service, and 
* their **potential** to better enable the service, including the goal of timesheeting by exception

## Scope

The discovery aims to 
* understand how SOR and rota fit into **inspection management workflow**
* examine what **data** is captured and how it is used
* examine **accuracy and consistency** of SOR and rota tools 
* understand what the resourcing **tools donâ€™t support** or enable
* examine **potential** to drive integrated timesheeting, SOR and rotas
* understand cultural **constraints** for inspection management service redesign

This discovery builds on previous work. To avoid duplication and focus on the resourcing tools in the inspection management context within the time available, it will not be looking into or revisiting:
* forecasting models based on resourcing tools and data
* charging model basis and codes review
* timesheeting
* broader HR & finance system review
