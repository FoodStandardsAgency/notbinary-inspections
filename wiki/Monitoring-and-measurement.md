## Continuous improvement as a way of working
Continuous improvement is a critical part of ensuring a service remains fit for purpose and making it a long-term success. Continuous improvement means having an ongoing approach to monitoring and measuring all the elements that make up a service and refining them as situations and business needs change.


## Continuous improvement and resourcing the Meat Plant Inspection service
### The situation today
* Continuous Improvement within Finance, and the Change & Business Implementation (CBI), and the Service Level Agreement (SLA) teams have separately looked at ways to monitor and measure efficiency in resourcing and managing meat plant inspections. 
* Finance and CBI have conducted some initial investigation into how better business planning could be carried out, but this work is on hold pending the outcome of this discovery project. User research with ITLs had not been included in the work to date.
* This initial work found that while operational resilience was good at the short-term (4-6 week) cluster level, the longer term (12-15 month) resilience planning was poor. This resulted in day-to-day firefighting to backfill resource demands and put pressure on the systems available for workforce planning. These findings are backed up by the output of this discovery. 
* It was also concluded that to leverage data that would enable continuous improvement, technical development work would be needed to pull data from a number of systems: E&P; rotas; and iTrent. Again, this is supported by the findings of this discovery.
* Data analytics reporting is undertaken by CBI, using PowerBI to compile data-driven reports. These reports are provided to relevant stakeholders in Field Operations and Finance on a regular basis. For those involved in meat plant inspections and related charging activities, the most relevant report is the [SOR Accuracy report](sor-accuracy-report). 
* The SLA team has found that SORs contain insufficient information, and are formatted in such a way that they cannot inform effective business planning or more productive working with service delivery partners. 
* The SLA team has carried out a survey with ITLs to answers questions around known issues with rotas, particularly to understand the reasons for frequent updates as part of managing the relationship with Eville & Jones. 
* Eville & Jones Area Resource Managers have also provided feedback on the additional work and complexity that the current way of working with rotas introduces to their own processes for providing the required resources, and the negative impact on the ability to deploy their staff in the most efficient way.
* Any other monitoring or measurement is currently done at the area/team level primarily via: ITLs reviewing the work being recorded in timesheets; Area Manager and ITL engagement with Food Business Operators (FBOs); and one-to-one reviews between ITLs and MHIs. These activities may highlight operational, skill, and resourcing issues which could trigger a review of the SOR and/or rota. Resolving these issues tends to be a very localised activity within an area, cluster or specific plant team.

However, because meat plant inspection is not currently organised as a complete end-to-end service it has been difficult to coordinate, capture and align the required information, or to design reports that would track factors that could drive consistency and efficiency. 

The principle challenge has been collating the required data that either is not currently recorded, or it is recorded in inconsistent formats. This means that workforce planning and forecasting becomes a manual and time-consuming task. The reliability and consistency of the data available is not trusted sufficiently to make workforce planning, forecasting or every day operational management as effective as it needs to be.

Basic statistics, such as the total number of inspection points across the country, either cannot be calculated from the data currently collected or can only be deduced by manually auditing SORs and rotas. There is no consistent audit trail for SORs or rotas that can be relied upon to show how often information is changed and why. It is incredibly difficult to create a baseline picture on which to design a monitoring approach.

### Future ways of working

There is a consensus among stakeholders that monitoring and measurement is needed to enable ongoing continuous improvement to the service:
* Scenario planning for service continuity in the event of incidents.
* Succession and retention planning for improved workforce management.
* Operational efficiency planning for improved day-to-day deployment of staff and better workforce planning with service delivery partners. 

To implement effective monitoring, the following are seen as potential steps:
* Adopting a service-led design approach to align the processes and tasks that make up meat plant inspections.
* Adopting a more collaborative approach to operating the component parts of meat plant inspections so that monitoring is designed to provide the right data for the right people at the right time.
* Increasing awareness of what better information management and reporting could do, and designing a reporting plan that is fit for purpose.
* Ensuring the required data is captured with a clear purpose and without duplicating effort. Service design and remapping processes would help to identify the information required and allow better consideration for when and how that information should be captured. The findings of this discovery suggest that some relatively simple changes to the SOR fields could deliver basic data (such as the number of inspection points in each plant) that would make a big difference to the national level planning that the SLA team would like to do, for example.
* Ensuring data is captured in formats that can be extracted and used as easily as possible. Again, service design and process mapping would inform how data could best be delivered to the people that need it.
