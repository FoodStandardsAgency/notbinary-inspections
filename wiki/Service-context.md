Resourcing is not a standalone activity. It is the part of an overarching Meat Plant Inspection service that ensures people with the right skills and experience deliver the FSA's legal obligation to provide controls in food businesses in England and Wales (Note. Delivery of those controls in Northern Ireland is not in scope for this discovery). 

### Operational context
Meat Plant Inspections are carried out at ~900 Food Business Operator (FBO) establishments across England & Wales by ~450 staff and ~350 contract personnel.

The FBOs are distributed across 33 FSA operational clusters, each of which is managed by an Inspection Team Leader (ITL). 

Each ITL develops, maintains and reviews (at least once annually) a [Statement of Resource](sor-context) (SOR) for each establishment in their cluster, setting out expected inspection resourcing requirements that the FSA will deliver (and charge) against. 

Each of the 33 ITLs maintains their own [staffing rota](rota-context) for their cluster of establishments, and together may make ~100 rota updates each week. A Service Delivery Partner maintains their own suite of rotas to allocate contract staff and coordinate FSA worker requests and rota changes, which are handled by 18 Resource Managers and Administrators nationally. 

### Governance overview
Various pieces of legislation, policy and business rules, operating at different points in the overarching Meat Plant Inspection service lifecycle, govern and influence the way resourcing for the service is delivered.

Five pieces of governance have been highlighted as playing a particular role in supporting the resourcing activities:

**EU Regulations:**
*  Articles 26, 27 & 28 Regulation EC No.882/2004 Meat Hygiene & Animal Welfare

**UK Regulations:** 
* The Meat (Official Controls Charges) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2019
* The Meat (Official Controls Charges) (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2019

**FSA Policy and Guidelines:**
* Charges Guide
* Statement of Resources Guidance


**Use of the Statement of Resources as a form of governance**

The Statement of Resources is not a legally-binding document between the FSA and the Food Business Operator. It is designed to assist the FBO to meet their obligation to declare their business operating hours and working practices to the FSA.

The SOR for each plant is referenced to validate inspection activity and work done, and the subsequent charging and payment processes.
