## Understand the service timeline

The service timeline gives a high-level view of the end-to-end process of resourcing meat plant inspections. It presents the lifecycle of resourcing with a service design lens. This breaks the process into a series of stages, from creating a service that enables business objectives, through operating the service effectively, with continuous improvement to complete activities efficiently.

The timeline outlines some typical tasks and activities related to getting the right people to the right plant at the right time. The timeline extends from the initial plant assessment through to maintaining an efficient and sustainable inspection service.

This timeline does not include related activities that make up the overarching Meat Plant Inspection service, such as completing timesheets or the downstream charging and payment processing.

#### Design
Assessing what activities are needed in order to deliver the required inspection work at each plant in order to enable the Food Business Operator to meet their business objectives and operate at the proposed volumes.

#### Build
Putting together a practical plan for delivering inspection work and related activities at each plant, to support the food business' operations.

#### Implement
Allocating people with the right skills required to deliver the agreed inspection work and related activities.

#### Run

#### Support
Resolving problems quickly so that people can continue to get their job done:
* Having a defined approach for managing and resolving technology incidents.
* Providing practical support to help people complete tasks and share knowledge and experience.
