Common threads currently hindering the service:
* Disparate collection of tools and practice - not a **coherent service**
* No common or clear **guidance** - practice evolves is handed down locally  
* **Multi-purpose systems**: obscures the core job to be done and confuses process and user flows
* Reliance on **off-system data points** 
* **Manual effort** to do simple things that could be automated
* **Time pressures** and pinch points are exacerbated
* **Partial context and visibility** to support decision making across the agency and supply chain

Inspection Team Leaders are empowered to manage resourcing at a cluster level. Local innovation and problem solving flourishes as peer networks support each other. This is at the expense of a well-formed national and service-wide approach to inspections delivery (including but also beyond the resourcing components). 

Service ownership and change leadership is compromised in the absence of a service-wide perspective of meat plant inspections. 

Inspection tools and systems can support and enable service improvements, but only if the service goals, constraints and behaviours are well-defined and clearly communicated. Collaboratively building a shared understanding of the service definition is critical before imposing technology solutions.
