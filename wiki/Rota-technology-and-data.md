## Technology and data: rota

Rotas are currently handled as spreadsheets. The format and function of rota spreadsheets varies between Inspection Team Leads (ITLs). Whilst a proportion of the format and function is common between rota spreadsheets, there remain significant differences in practice.

In addition to rotas maintained by ITLs, the Service Delivery Partner (SDP) also needs to maintain a a form of rotas in order to match contract staff to ITL needs. Where these needs change, there is a need to update and email revised rotas, in addition to notifying contractors and verifying that notifications have been received.

This requires significant manual coordination effort and duplicates data across multiple spreadsheets, whilst also risking miscommunication and inconsistency in the process.

### Current technology

 * Spreadsheets

 The current technology in use is Excel. However it should be noted that there are often multiple copies of a rota being worked on in parallel, for example where staff availability has changed and this change needs to be communicated to E&J, who may already be working on a previous copy of the rota.  

### Data considerations

Preparation of Rotas is currently done using spreadsheets, often with multiple copies in circulation until the rota is finalised, with changes occasionally made on the fly afterwards. The current process is labour-intensive and can require substantial manual effort to coordinate and confirm roles and availability, particularly when collaborating with E&J.

The rotas process is not able to make direct use of SOR, people, leave and public holiday data stored in other systems. This reqires ITLs in particular to maintain (and juggle) a mental model of requirement and availability of staff, with a corresponding workload also falling to E&J to support resourcing needs.

Moving to a situation where API access is readily available to directly access the sources of information required to support building rotas in partnership with the Service Delivery Provider(s) could significanly streamline the process, reducing workload and ultimately cost to FSA of this component of the overall inspections service.

The primary source of information for Rotas would be the SOR as this sets out roles and hours of operation. Additionally, information about staff leave, public holidays and individual contract conditions could be used to support ITLs and supplement their local knowledge of individual staff member skills and experience.

A unified view of the state of rotas, sharing the appropriate level of information with each party, would enable a more collaborative working relationship with SDP(s) and provide individuals with a current and up-to-date view of their shifts. With supportive data sharing in place, it should be possible to remove a significant proportion of the burden of manual coordination and provide additional features such as automatic notifications and potentitally a more accurate view of actual work done, with corresponding benefits to improved reporting.

The aim would be to enable each type of data to be accessed from a single authoritative source. This could avoid duplication, manual effort to move data between systems and possible discrepancy (especially around times when changes are made). The technology underpinning the overall inspection service can be visualised as a network of inter-related components, each with a clear, focused single function that meets needs of dependent systems. For example, SOR and iTrent could be two separate systems that provide data via API to Rotas. In turn, Rotas could provide data via API downstream systems including reporting and, potentially Timesheets.

### Recommendations

The current rota process is implemented using spreadsheets, off-system knowledge (including individual expertise, but also data which is held in other systems) and manual email, phone and text communications to coordinate resourcing.

There is an opportunity to significantly improve this process and reduce levels of manual effort required to reliably and appropriately resource plants. A key difference between the current Rota process and the SOR process is that, whilst the SOR process is standardised, rotas are implemented differently by different Inspection Team Leads (ITLs). 

There is therefore a need to understand differences in practice in order to design a workable standardised process (and potential technology solution) that ensures ITLs are supported in managing the plants they are responsible for.

The following key areas of opportunity should be considered if a standardised process can be designed:

 * Ensure a smooth user experience to facilitate efficient development and adjustment of rotas
 * Look for opportunities to extend the rota process to collaboratively include Service Delivery Partners (SDP) in order to facilitate delivery of contractors
 * Integrate rotas with data sources that can help improve user experience, such as information about SOR, plants, sites, activity codes and approved staff/contractors and the roles they can perform
 * Enable rotas to expose scheduling data in such a way that this could be used to support an improved timesheeting process
 * Enable rota data to feed in to improved reporting and enable FSA to continuously improve field operations, such as better collaboration with SDP(s) or transparency of resource utilisation across plants, clusters and regions.
